Thus, researchers are working to improve methodologies for occupant-based demand-control heating, ventilation, and air conditioning. Sensor usage for occupancy detection is among the methodologies researched for controlling consumption. Carbon dioxide sensors proved to be effective but overly sensitive to configuration. Research also proved that there is an undetermined latency period between the changes of the number of occupants and the carbon dioxide sensors detection of that change. We present a work in progress method to determine the best placement of carbon dioxide sensors for the accurate occupants' detection and calculation of latency using the Cellular Discrete-Event Specifications formalism. We present several case studies showing resemblance between physical closed spaces and the models and how the simulation replicates real-life scenarios.","tags":[],"title":"Cell DEVS Models for CO2 Sensors Locations in Closed Spaces","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dr. Hoda Khalil","Âê≥ÊÅ©ÈÅî"],"categories":["Demo","ÊïôÁ®ã"],"content":"Overview  The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

In this paper, we study the relationship between the different operators used to insert mutants in the fault domain of the system under test and the effectiveness of different state machine test suites at killing those mutants. We are particularly interested in the effectiveness of two interrelated state machine testing strategies at finding different types of faults. Those are the round-trip paths strategy and the transition tree strategy. Using empirical evaluation, we compare the effectiveness of more than two thousand unique test suites at killing mutants seeded using eight different mutation operators. We perform experiments on four experimental objects and provide qualitative analysis of the results. We conclude that neither of the two studied strategies is more effective than the other at killing a certain type of mutants. However, the structure of the finite state machine and the nature of the system under test affect the type of faults detected by the different testing strategies.","tags":[],"title":"Comparing Transition Trees Test Suites Effectiveness for Different Mutation Operators","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1596940789,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1596940789,"objectID":"ef9f405ffe16734a7678b1bebda51389","permalink":"https://hakhalil.github.io/talk/comparing-transition-trees-test-suites-effectiveness-for-different-mutation-operators/","publishdate":"2021-08-09T22:39:49-04:00","relpermalink":"/talk/comparing-transition-trees-test-suites-effectiveness-for-different-mutation-operators/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Comparing Transition Trees Test Suites Effectiveness for Different Mutation Operators","type":"event"},{"authors":["Hoda Khalil and Gabriel Wainer"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1586810947,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1586810947,"objectID":"01c202ebebfbda3f397e38336dbc4204","permalink":"https://hakhalil.github.io/publication/celldevs-for-social-phenomena-modelling/","publishdate":"2021-08-09T16:49:07-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/celldevs-for-social-phenomena-modelling/","section":"publication","summary":"Motivated by the need for formal methods as well as supporting tools to model and simulate social systems, we propose Cellular Discrete Event System Specification as a formalism for modeling social systems.

Therefore, testing systems that are modeled with state machines has received genuine attention. Among the studied testing strategies are complete round-trip paths and transition trees that cover roundtrip paths in a piece wise manner. We present an empirical study that aims at comparing the effectiveness of the complete roundtrip paths test suites to the transition trees test suites in one hand, and comparing the effectiveness of the different techniques used to generate transition trees (breadth first traversal, depth first traversal, and random traversal) on the other hand. We also compare the effectiveness of all the testing trees generated using each single traversal criterion. This is done through conducting an empirical evaluation using four case studies from different domains. Effectiveness is evaluated with mutants. Experimental results are presented and analyzed.","tags":[],"title":"On FSM Based Testing an Empirical Study on Complete Round Trip Versus Transition Trees","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://hakhalil.github.io/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
